Topic Modeler Application


Overview: Developed a Java-based desktop application that compares the similarity between two text files by analyzing and scoring their content based on word frequency.

Key Features:

User Interface: Designed an intuitive GUI using Swing, allowing users to select files, adjust settings, and view results through a user-friendly layout.
File Processing: Implemented file reading and text processing capabilities to handle and analyze textual data from user-selected files.
Algorithm: Developed an algorithm to calculate a similarity score based on the frequency of common words between two files. The algorithm filters out stopwords and sorts words by frequency to determine similarity.
Settings Adjustment: Integrated a slider component to allow users to specify the number of top words considered in the comparison, enhancing the flexibility of the scoring system.
File Output: Implemented functionality to output the most common words from each file to text files, facilitating easy review and analysis.
Technologies Used: Java, Swing, File I/O, Stream API, Lambda Expressions
